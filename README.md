## How Bar's Loaded Works

When it comes to weightlifting, understanding which plates to load onto your barbell based on the weight you wish to lift can be tricky. Bar's Loaded simplifies this process. All you have to do is input the weight you want to lift, and the app takes care of the rest. It provides a visual representation of the barbell and its plates, showing you exactly how many of each plate you need.
